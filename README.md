What am I doing ... ?

Non OAuth client can only make 30 requests/min going over limit can result in account ban (perhaps IP ban as well?)
It is the user-agent that tells reddit how to limit you. DO NOT lie to them about your user-agent or spoof other
agents. This can result in the banhammer!

## Setup
Make a file called creds. In this file you will have two lines. The two lines are in the
following format:

```
USER=your_username
PASS=your_password
```

## Tasks
* Notify mods?

## Issues
* Nested comments with same url are not detected
